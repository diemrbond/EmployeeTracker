## Description 
  For this project, we needed to create a mysql database using schema and seeds, and a CLI that allowed users to ADD, UPDATE, VIEW and DELETE the ROLES, DEPARTMENT and EMPLOYEES. 
  
  Additional functionality allows the user to VIEW EMPLOYEES by DEPARTMENT and MANAGER, view the DEPARTMENT BUDGET, confirm before DELETE. 
  
  Packages used include mysql, inquirer, console.tables.
